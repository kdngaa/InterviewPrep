//INTERVIEW TIPS AND TRICKS
//GO OVER FRONT END COURSES and SYSTEM DESIGN VIDEOS ON ALGO
//DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM PRORITIZES BEFORE THINKING OF SOLUTIONS
//GO OVER EVERY DATA TYPES ARRAY, STRINGS, OBJECTS
//BIG O NOTATION IS simplified analysis of an algorithm's efficiency
// complexity in terms of input size N; can be used to analyze time and space
//big o ignores constant (exp: 5n --> O(n) n input doesnt matter when becomes large)
// O(1) is constant time



//// 2 Sum EASY
//BETTER WAY: HASH TABLES GIVES YOU MORE SPACE, makes it run faster and more efficiently (value time more than space)
//MOST OPTIMAL: USING SORT IN THE BEGINNING and using WHILE LOOP (value space more than time)
//REVIEW BIG-O, KNOWING HOW TO READ OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS IS A BIG PLUS
//REVIEW HASHMAPS AND HASH TABLES, SLIDING WINDOWS AND TWO POINTERS


///3 Sum MEDIUM
